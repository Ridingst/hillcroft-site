# Game Day Routine

Lacrosse players come in all shapes and sizes, from different faiths and creeds, and have different Game Day rituals and routines. Here are two basic plans to follow, based on the two main types of athlete, that can be adjusted as appropriate.

## Get Up
**Option A**

Rise at a sensible hour. For optimal performance, excessive drinking the night before is not advised. Get some upbeat tunes on to get you in the mood. 

**Option B**

Roll out of bed an hour before face-off at a venue across London. Crawl to bathroom. Cleanse. Avoid all surplus noise for fear of head exploding. 


## Load Up

**Option A**

Have a balanced and nutritious breakfast. Porridge, good. Peanut butter toast, good. Banna, good. Enjoy nice coffee to help with healthy bowel movements.

**Option B**

Find half a lukewarm can of Stella and some cold pizza on table. Consume. Smash down double espresso just to feel something. Evacuate bowels violently.


## Kit Up
**Option A**

Dress in appropriate layers dependent on conditions. Apply supplementary comfort measures such as KT tape or blister plasters if necessary.

**Option B**

Chuck on a comfortable hoodie or any other item not soiled from the night before.

## Turn Up (part 1)

**Option A**

Meet at the arranged rendezvous point with like-minded teammates to travel together via carpool or public transport to build up team relations and also help the environment. 

**Option B**

Miss lift and realise public transport takes two hours. Uber has 15% off but ride is still £40. Order anyway. 

## Warm Up

**Option A**

Having arrived with plenty of time, take time to stretch out tight muscles to avoid injury while playing. Loosen up hands with basic passing drills.

**Option B**

Turn up 15 mins into drills (stuck in traffic). Slowly put kit on then have a breather. Avoid threatening vomit. Take paracetamol and a casual lap. Hold head in hands.

## F*** Sh** Up

**Option A and B**

Do as subheading suggests. Leave it all on the field. It’s Game Day baby!

## Hydrate Up

**Option A**

Enjoy a nice casual pint and a post match debrief with the fellas. Have a second if you really want but don’t over do it and don’t feel peer pressured to do anything you don’t want to.

**Option B**

Clip clop clip clop, back on the horse. You made it through, well done! Now enjoy some well earned irresponsible drinking*! You can deal with a “hangover” tomorrow.
