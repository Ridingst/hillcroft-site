      <p class="font-serif tracking-wider lg:tracking-widest leading-widest italic pt-6 text-gray-900">
        Our Men’s 1st Team compete at the highest level in the South of England, the SEMLA Premier Division.
        A blend of seasoned veterans and international players, they were runners-up in the 2018/19 season, narrowly missing out to Hampstead.

        Our Men’s 2nd Team sees a mix of experienced hands and more recent graduates play together. They have been one of the dominant forces in SEMLA
        Division 1 for a number of seasons, and hope to continue this as the club approaches our 50th anniversary in 2021.

      <p class="font-serif tracking-wider lg:tracking-widest leading-widest italic pt-6 text-gray-900">
        Our Men’s 3rd Team brings together some of our more inexperienced players and a range of members who might not always be able to train,
        but who are keen to keep lacrosse in their lives each week. It’s a fantastic opportunity to play some fast, friendly lacrosse.
